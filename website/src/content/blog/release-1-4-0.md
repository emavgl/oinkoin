We're excited to announce the release of Oinkoin version **1.4.0**! This update brings a complete redesign of the statistics page, transforming how you understand and interact with your financial data.

## Your Financial Story, Beautifully Visualized

The statistics page has been completely reimagined to help you make better financial decisions with confidence.

### See the Big Picture

Understanding your finances should be effortless. The new statistics page presents your financial data in beautiful, easy-to-read charts that tell your money story at a glance. Whether you want to see how your spending evolves over time or compare this month to last month, everything is now clearer and more intuitive.

### Find What Matters to You

Everyone looks at their finances differently. That's why we've added powerful new filtering options that let you slice and dice your data exactly how you need it. Want to see how much you spent on groceries last quarter? Or track your income trends over the past year? Now you can do it with just a few taps.

### Explore Your Spending Patterns

Dive deeper into your categories and tags with dedicated detail pages. Tap on any category or tag to see its complete breakdown, transaction history, and trends over time. It's never been easier to spot opportunities to save or understand where your money goes.

### Smart Time Grouping

View your statistics by day, week, month, or custom periods. The flexible grouping options adapt to how you think about your budget, whether you're planning for the week ahead or reviewing your yearly progress.

### Designed for Clarity

Every element has been refined to reduce clutter and highlight what matters most. The new design puts your most important financial metrics front and center, while detailed information is always just a tap away when you need it.
